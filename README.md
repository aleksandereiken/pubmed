# pubmed

A shiny app, which allows users to search for medical literature via the PubMed API. 
Furthermore, the users can get the journals, which most often publish articles within
the area of the search, as well as mostly published authors. This is useful for selecting
which journal you need for publishing your new article, or for selecting reviewers. 
Finally, the app downloads all abstracts, and lets you search these for easily identifying
interesting significant findings. This is useful for identifying a reference when writing
medical literature. You can find the app live here: https://aleksandereiken.shinyapps.io/pubmed_app/
